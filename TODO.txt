==== TODO ====

- Grid view
	- Draw grid dots / lines - not found a good solution yet :/
	- Change snap level - OK

- Undo stack - OK

- Camera - OK
	- Moveable tile selector - OK, but not 100% happy. should probably not be modal.
	- Moveable map - OK

- Group editing - Some progress
	- Main group (road, grass, bridge etc.) - OK
	- Sub group (direction / variant)
	- Clear selection
	
- Tooltip with group info and zoomed current tile when hovering the view
	- Applicable for both views

- Label / info message with implicit trace - Partly OK
	- Status bar - OK, but not good enough. Probably needs more labels to avoid 'jitter'
	- Messages instead of trace

- Tile path editor
	- Start with simple vectors first
		- Multiple vectors per tile
		- Snap?

- Save / Load <- at this point we only develop native
	- Map data
	- Tilesheet

- Consider using luxe standard isometric map instead of custom (bad) implementation

- Change grid size

- Redo support

- Object editor (pre-define buildings etc.)
